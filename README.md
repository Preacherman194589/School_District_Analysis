# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis:

Chief PyCity School District Data Analysis Maria asked if I could help capture and format the data numbers from the school's student standardized test scores and student fund. Once the numbers are captured, she would like to present the findings to the school board for budget concerns and needs. 

## Results: 

Based on my analysis, I noticed that seven school district metrics were affected due to changes. Below is the information I was able to gather: 



1. District Summary: I was presented with two complete sheets, one represented 15 schools within District, and the other showed several charters and district schools. The student population appeared to be 39,170. I noticed that the ninth graders at Thomas High School showed a very low performance due to testing. The passing average caused a low performance overall throughout the District. I decided to tag the numbers of 9th graders at Thomas High School and replace the reading and math scores with a null value (Nan) district. Most of the 10th, 11th, and 12th graders at Thomas High School received a grade of 70 or greater. 




2. School Summary: By removing 461 9th graders from Thomas High School, I had a new count that appeared to help the overall numbers at Thomas High School. An area of interest was the drop in budget from $82,932,329,558 to $24, 649,428. Even our math, reading, and overall scores showed improvement in the original numbers at Thomas High School showed math, reading, and overall score, respectively. 66.9% (passing math), 69.6% (passing reading) and 65% (overall passing). The new count shows 93% (passing math), 97% (passing reading), and 90% (overall passing), a great recovery.



3. High and Low Performing Schools: The numbers also show the top 5 schools in the District below, compared to the top 5 bottom schools, a consistency of 90% high across the board. Removing the low number of performances from the 9th graders at Thomas High School truly impacted the District's overall numbers. 




4. Math and Reading scores by Grade: The overall grade level within the school district also jumped. The average math and reading score before the new count was 77%; the new count shows an average of 81%.

 
11. Scores by School Spending: The average spending per student is $628. You have an overall look at spending per student and the number of students from every 15 schools. The data allows you to see the cost and spending per test. 


12. Scores by School Size: To get the total budget of the top five schools, we add the school size and spending per student. Thomas High School shows an overall average of 90% with a school size between 1000 - 1999:

 

13.	Scores by School Type: The charter school students had a slight edge over district students; however, both school types showed an overall passing rate of 90%: 



## Summary
 The four changes that changed enhanced the school performance numbers are: 
1. Overall passing average passing rate jump higher  
2. Budget declined  
3. Able to Identify schools that need improvement 
4. Schools that pay more per student
